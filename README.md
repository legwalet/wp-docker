# wp-docker
quick setup of a Wordpress site on a Docker container 

# you will have to do a couple of things first:

- create a directories <code> mkdir ./db_data && mkdir ./wp_content <code/> 
- setup your dedicated nfs server before running container (modify nfs folder & names IP address as you wish)
